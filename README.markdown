#What is IrcLib?#
IrcLib is an event-driven IRC library and bot framework. It is written in C# with Mono. It is cross-platform and fully open-source with the MIT License.

#Documentation#
IrcLib is currently lacking in documentation. This is planned to be fixed soon. Until the documentation is complete, you can check out the examples to figure out how to use the library.

#Examples#
* [ParrotBot](IrcLib/Examples/ParrotBot.cs) - A bot which replies to the channel with the same messages.
* [HelloBot](IrcLib/Examples/HelloBot.cs) - A bot which responds to the messages containing "hello".

#Features#
* Event-driven
* Handles pings automatically
* Written in pure-C# with sockets
* Very easy to use. Check out the ParrotBot example to see the amount of code needed to have a working bot.
